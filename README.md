## :Speech Ballon: About
- How this game was built
- Download instructions (if relevant):
```zsh
$ git clone my-awesome-app
$ cd my-awesome-app
$ node app.js
```


## :Memo: Planning & Problem Solving
-Start building the Html and then jump straight to CSS.

-Sketch about the data I would need for the project to understand how to use the variables. This is the order I decided to use:

1) Deciding to set player1 as the first player and giving it the string 'X'. The second player 'O' and I typed both as const as they would change.

2) Use a `FOR` loop to select ny boxes and to add the 'click' event to each one.

3)Use a function to set the current player and to set Player1 with the first option. Aditionally I created a function to prevent overwriting each box.

4)Next step: the winningCheck where I can set all the possibilities each player have to win.

5)Think about how to let the players know who wins and if there is a draw Match.

6)Think a way to reset the game once the players are done.



## :rocket: Cool tech
- Javascript
- Libraries
- Animations
- Palett color, and features on boxes

## :scream: Bugs to fix :poop:
- The winningCheck function was re done several times as I failed on calling them correctly.
This part was long, so I managed to make it a bit shorter using logic operators such as && and || on each if statement.

- I used if statements to set the winning options on my board therefore my code is long.



## :sob: Lessons learnt
I would spent more time to work on my JS code first and then spend the rest of the time on the CSS part. 

Thinking about Html tags name can reduce working time because I realised some needed to be renamed due while working in Javascript part.

## :National Park: Future features
I would like to add a sense of 3 dimension game kind of navigation site before playing. 

Also, to add a theme according the geographic user location. For example: a beach theme if people play in Bali, and set the game to be used remotely for the 2 players.
